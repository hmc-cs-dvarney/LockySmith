# LockySmith
Locky Smith was a vertical-scroller game where you played a jaded Lock Smith trying to navigate the world. Some of this code was written by me, some of it was written by an outside developer we hired, Lin, may he rest in peace. All the well commented was written by me of course, and all the bad code was somebody else's doing ;)
